# Alpha Piscium v1.4.2

# New
- Added option to change weighting between stratus and cumulus cloud
- Added cloud horizon fading
- Added detail wind to volumetric cloud

# Improvement
- Improved phase function for SSS
- Added transmittance-based early exit to volumetric cloud as optimization
- Jitter cloud ambient irradiance lut sampling for smoother ambient lighting
- Improved cumulus and cirrus cloud shape
- Removed color grading bloom fix
- Added variable volumetric cloud ray step count optimization

# Fix
- Fixed material albedo gamma decoding
- Fixed GI reproject ghosting caused by an accidental change in 334ca9be
- Fixed cloud noise caused by wrong lighting ray jitter
- Fixed DOF manual focus

# Notice
- The volumetric cloud is still very unoptimized. For now, it is advised not to change the coverage to a value > 0.6.
