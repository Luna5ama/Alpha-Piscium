# Alpha Piscium v1.4.1

# New
- Added experimental Distant Horizon support

# Improvement
- Optimized atmosphere transmittance and mulit-scattering LUT performance
- Changed GI default strength settings
- Changed AE default settings
- Slightly improved cloud lighting details
- Updated cloud medium coefficients accuracy
- Improve day-night transition temporal history resetting

# Fix
- Fixed back face emissive GI
- Fixed history reset not applying to all cloud ambient lighting LUT layers.

# Notice
- The volumetric cloud is still very unoptimized. For now, it is advised not to change the coverage to a value > 0.5.
- Distant Horizon support is still experimental and visual bugs are expected.
