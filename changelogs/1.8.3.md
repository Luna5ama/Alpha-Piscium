# Alpha Piscium v1.8.3

## Highlight
- **Major performance optimizations on rasterization pass**
- **Config profiles for different quality/performance tiers**

## New
- Added config profiles for different quality/performance tiers
- Added Assume NV GPU option for NVIDIA-specific optimizations
- Separated SSS sample count from blocker search count for better control

## Improvement
- Optimized gbuffer pass viewZ attribute by computing from gl_FragCoord.w
- Optimized terrain draw normal vertex attributes
- Optimized shadow pass attributes
- Optimized denoiser reproject register usage
- Optimized denoiser stabilization pass occupancy
- Removed some vertex attributes for passes that don't need them
- Optimized SST register usage and ray sorting key layout
- Optimized GI5 storing handle register usage
- DenoiseBlur FP16 optimization
- ReSTIR temporal reuse math simplification
- Early return branching optimization
- Updated TAA filter kernel for lower quality profile
- Reduced TAA motion blur
- Tone mapping tweak
- Moved cloud clear from GIReproject to ShadowSample pass to balance VRAM loads
- Moved fast history storing to history fix pass to balance VRAM loads
- Emissive color curve now performed in input color space for better consistency
- Removed spatial reuse feedback due to firefly artifacts

## Fix
- Fixed hit distance on disocclusion
- Fixed backward analysis distance check
- Fixed GBufferTranslucent material id reading
- Fixed RTWSM forward analysis writing position
- Fixed extra water tinting
- Fixed history length diffusion killing disocclusion fix

## Misc
- Removed unused shadow specular output and associated references
- Removed reservoir age reset
